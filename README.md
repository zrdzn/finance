# Finance
## üìñ Overview
**Finance** is a tool for managing personal and shared finances.
It allows users to create vaults where they can track payments, 
manage products, and categorize expenses.
Users can invite others to their vaults to collaborate.
The app provides detailed statistics, such as total income and expenses, 
and allows users to export transactions to a .CSV file.
With currency conversion and a design optimized for mobile devices,
**Finance** makes it easy to manage finances on any device.
The backend is built with Kotlin and offers a REST API, 
while the frontend uses Next.js with TypeScript.
The project is structured using DDD to organize the system into distinct domains,
with a [design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/ddd-oriented-microservice) 
that supports future migration to microservices.
